[Article Link](https://vercel.com/guides/using-express-with-vercel)

Provided above is a link to an article about how developers can setup express and deploy it to vercel. It provides a comprehensive step-by-step tutorial on how to create the express app via Node.js and create a basic server with a single GET endpoint. Afterwards, it covers how to configure this express project for vercel deployment.

I find this article interesting because I come back to it once in a while whenever I am developing and deploying an express app to the open internet. I have very much liked the conciseness and clarity of this article and I believe it is highly beneficial to the developer community.

## Comment
I didn't know about the serverless architecutre before reading the article. I did some research and liked the concept of a server that doesn't run 24/7 in the background, which can be a cost saving measurment in multiple scenarios.
