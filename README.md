Provided above is a link to an article about how developers can setup express and deploy it to vercel. It provides a comprehensive step-by-step tutorial on how to create the express app via Node.js and create a basic server with a single GET endpoint. Afterwards, it covers how to configure this express project for vercel deployment.

I find this article interesting because I come back to it once in a while whenever I am developing and deploying an express app to the open internet. I have very much liked the conciseness and clarity of this article and I believe it is highly beneficial to the developer community.
